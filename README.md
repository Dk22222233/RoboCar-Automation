My project is inspired from autonomous EVs.
It uses 3 IR sensors to detect black surface and use 1 Ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles.
It uses Arduino for proper decision making and signal proccessing.
I uses four DC motor with TB6612FNG controller to perform it's motion according to Arduino out pins.
It has no mechanical steering mecanism, but it use tank like steering via programming logic.
